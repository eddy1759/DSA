## What is ORM

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, and it is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented programming concepts. The basic idea behind ORM is to abstract away the complexities of working with a database, so that developers can interact with the database using code that is closer to the way they think about the data.

## Types of ORM
There are several different types of ORM frameworks, including:

- Full ORM: This type of ORM maps all of the tables in a database to objects in code. This can be useful for complex systems with many tables, but can also be overkill for simpler applications.

- Micro ORM: This type of ORM only maps a subset of the tables in a database to objects in code. This can be a good compromise between simplicity and functionality.

- Lightweight ORM: This type of ORM is designed to be easy to use and require minimal configuration.

## Uses of ORM

ORM frameworks can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Simplifying database access: ORM frameworks can reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to interact with a database, making it easier to create and maintain database-backed applications.

- Improving code quality: By abstracting away the details of working with a database, ORM frameworks can help developers focus on writing higher-level, more expressive code.

- Providing cross-database compatibility: ORM frameworks can often be used with multiple types of databases, allowing developers to switch databases without having to rewrite their code.

- Increasing performance: ORM frameworks can often provide caching and other performance optimizations to reduce the amount of time required to access data from a database.
