## What ODM is

ODM is a type of software that maps data from a database to an object in an object-oriented programming language. This mapping allows developers to easily store, manipulate, and retrieve data from the database without having to worry about the underlying database structure.

ODM libraries provide an interface between the application and the database. They allow developers to define models or classes that represent the data in the database, and then map those models to the actual database tables and columns.

## How does ODM work?

ODM works by mapping data from the database to an object in the programming language. This mapping is done using a set of rules defined by the ODM library. The rules define how the data in the database should be represented in the programming language.

ODM libraries use a variety of techniques to map the data from the database to the programming language. Some libraries use reflection to dynamically create object models based on the database schema, while others use a more explicit mapping approach where developers define the mapping themselves.

ODM libraries also provide a set of methods for interacting with the data in the database. These methods typically include CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations, as well as more complex queries and data aggregation operations.

### Popular ODM Libraries

- Mongoose is a popular ODM library for MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. It provides a simple, yet powerful interface for defining data models and interacting with MongoDB.

- Sequelize is a popular ODM library for SQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. It provides a powerful and flexible interface for defining data models and performing complex queries.
