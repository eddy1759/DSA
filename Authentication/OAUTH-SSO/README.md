## OAUTH AND SSO
- OAuth (Open Authorization) and SSO (Single Sign-On) are two popular authentication mechanisms used by many applications. 

- OAuth allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources, without sharing their credentials.
- SSO allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications. SSO can be implemented in different ways, but the most common approach is to use a protocol called SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language). SAML defines a set of rules for exchanging authentication and authorization data between the identity provider (the server that authenticates the user) and the service provider (the application that the user wants to access).
