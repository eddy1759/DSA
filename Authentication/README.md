# Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.

There are different approaches to implementing authentication in JavaScript web applications. Some common approaches include:

- Basic authentication
- Form-based authentication
- Token-based authentication

Here's an example of how token-based authentication can be implemented in JavaScript using JWT:

- User logs in with their credentials, which are sent to the server.
- The server verifies the credentials and generates a token using JWT.
- The token is sent back to the client as a response to the login request.
- The client stores the token in local storage or a cookie.
- With each subsequent request, the client sends the token in the header of the request.
- The server verifies the token using the same secret key used to sign the token during generation.
- If the token is valid, the server grants access to the requested resource.

### Authorization
Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has permission to access a particular resource.

There are different approaches to implementing authorization in JavaScript web applications. Some common approaches include:

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Rule-based access control
