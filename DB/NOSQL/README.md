## NOSQL

*NoSQL* (short for "not only SQL") is a type of database management system that does not use the traditional relational database model. 

NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of `unstructured`, `semi-structured`, or `structured` data and provide a more flexible, scalable, and efficient approach to data management.

Some popular NoSQL databases include: 
- MongoDB
- Cassandra
- CouchDB 
- Redis
- Amazon DynamoDB. 

NoSQL databases are often used in big data and real-time web applications, where the `volume`, `velocity`, and `variety` of data require a more flexible and scalable solution than a traditional relational database.

Each NoSQL database has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use depends on the specific needs of the application. 

For example, some NoSQL databases are designed for high *performance* and *scalability*, while others are designed to be highly flexible and support complex data structures.

In general, NoSQL databases provide an alternative to traditional relational databases for modern, high-scale data-driven applications.
