## DATABASE INDEX
- A database index is a data structure that is used to improve the performance of queries. Essentially, an index is a way to organize data in the database to allow for faster search and retrieval of information.

- Indexes are an essential tool for optimizing the performance of a database. Without indexes, the database would have to scan every row in a table to find the data requested by a query. This can be very slow for large tables with millions of rows. By contrast, an index can drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to retrieve data from a table.

- In addition to improving query performance, indexes can also improve the efficiency of other database operations, such as sorting and grouping data. However, indexes also have some drawbacks. They take up additional storage space on disk, and they can slow down data modification operations (such as inserts, updates, and deletes) because the database must update both the table and the index.
